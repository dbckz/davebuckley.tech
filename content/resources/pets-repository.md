# PETs deployments catalogue

I've worked on a couple of PETs repositories, including the [UN Case Study repository](https://unstats.un.org/bigdata/task-teams/privacy/case-studies) and the [CDEI's Repository of PETs Use Cases](https://cdeiuk.github.io/pets-adoption-guide/repository) (later migrated to a less fun [GOV.UK webpage](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/repository-of-privacy-enhancing-technologies-pets-use-cases)). 

However, I regularly come across example deployments that I find it useful to track.

This resource is intended as a simple, light-touch database of different PETs deployments I come across, where I can record them quickly without writing a particularly detailed description. It will not go into much detail on any use case -- that will be done in the more mature repositories metnioned above.

All information used is publicly avaiable, any errors are my own.
